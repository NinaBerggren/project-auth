# Project Auth API 
Nina Berggren & Joel Ã–hman

This week's project we have been working in pairs and practised authorization in backend, using bcrypt and crypto npm packages. 
We connected our backend to a frontend that can create new users, login and display content which requires authentication. Frontend created with React routes.

New concept for this week is the access token, which is created in backend and accessed in frontend to authenticate the user.
